      <br/><br/>This game was crafted in just 48 hours by a passionate team of five, blending creativity, humor, and a love for video games. All the assets were created by our team, inspired by the carefree spirit of classic skateboarding games but with a playful and adorable twist. 
      <br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the ultimate "soapboarder" of the bathtub? Show off your best tricks, rack up points, and prove that even a rubber duck can become a legend!</>),
